### Description
This project is the beginnings of a game called Snipe Hunt!

From the Wiki

A snipe hunt is a type of practical joke or fool's errand, in existence in North America as early as the 1840s, in which an unsuspecting newcomer is duped into trying to catch an elusive, nonexistent animal called a snipe. Although snipe are an actual family of birds, a snipe hunt is a quest for an imaginary creature whose description varies.

The target of the prank is led to an outdoor spot and given instructions for catching the snipe; these often include waiting in the dark and holding an empty bag or making noises to attract the creature. The others involved in the prank then leave the newcomer alone in the woods to discover the joke. As an American rite of passage, snipe hunting is often associated with summer camps and groups such as the Boy Scouts. In France, a similar joke is called "hunting the dahut".

### Technologies Used
Scanner

while loops

for loops

arrays

public static final



### Lessons Learned
communication between partners is essential

care and feeding of git so no overwrites happen

team work with git, needing to pull before push to make sure no stomping on each others code
must have good collaboration

team work for development - how to split out work efforts so that no one person is in a position
of being overwhelmed with work


### Checklist

status as of 10/9/2024
Abner and Kathy worked on initial design of our Game Snipe Hunt
we managed to get classes, attributes and methods called out for most of our project

we will need to finish up our class for the Snipe but on the whole have a good working outline
